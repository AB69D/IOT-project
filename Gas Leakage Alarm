Gas Leakage Alarm:
A methane (CH4) gas leakage alert system is a system that is designed to detect and alert individuals due to methane gas leak. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is released into the atmosphere from a variety of sources, including the decomposition of organic matter, the production of natural gas, and the digestion of food by animals. It is also flammable and can be explosive at high concentrations. Therefore, it is important to detect and address methane gas leaks as quickly as possible to prevent accidents and mitigate the impact on the environment. Methane (CH4) gas is commonly used for cooking in many households. However, it is important to make sure that gas appliances, such as stoves and ovens, are properly installed and maintained to prevent gas leaks. Methane gas is flammable and can be explosive at high concentrations, so even small leaks can pose a risk of fire or explosion.If you suspect a methane gas leak in your home, it is important to take immediate action to address the problem. Methane (CH4) gas detection device that is equipped with a methane gas sensor and an alarm system. These types of devices are used to detect the presence of methane gas in the air and provide an alert when a leak is detected. They may be connected to a central monitoring system that can send notifications to maintenance personnel or emergency responders, or they may simply sound an alarm or send a notification to a local device.
Here is some feature of the device : 
A sensor (CH4) tries to trigger an alarm through a buzzer.
If gas is detected there will be a red light otherwise there will be a green light.
When gas is detected, users will get notifications via mobile phone .
